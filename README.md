## Game Mechanic
to control the player you can use w,a,s,d and space for jump, and enter or left mouse click for attak

## Coding Challenge
the hardest part of the coding is to understand about the concept of global signal in godot and the node system. for this specific project, it is also quite challenging to implement the state concept for the characters

## Interesting feature
What is the most interesting part of the game?
the most interesting part of the game is actually the health system for the enemy, so you have to hit them more than once to kill them

# Reflection

Reflection on learning.  This is very important.  You need to think about what you are learning and how it is making you better at using the engine.
the concept that i really proud of that i learn in this project is understanding the concept of signal and how scene works in godot. even though i already learn about singleton, it is an eye opener once i know how to use and add a scene into another scene or node, it is probably the most important thing to understand in using game engine in general. for the signal, once i learn about it, it just open a lot more possibilities when making the game.
